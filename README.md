# Process Custom Post to slider

Task 1: Different "slides" that make up the content be categorized (like WordPress posts have categories) so the content for The Process has a specific category (like Collaboration) and fx. Another page can pull a different category (like FAQ)? 
 
Task 2: Create an inverted version of the slider (for use on white/light grey backgrounds). Admin need to set custom class light or dark.
 
Task 3: Slider specific icon. FOR ICON â€“ to have active inactive state, you need to create icon properly. Please check attachment, we have created a psd file for you. Active state icon at top and inactive icon at the bottom.
